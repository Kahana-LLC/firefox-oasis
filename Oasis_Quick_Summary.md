# Oasis Browser - Quick Issue Summary

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Application Cannot Launch

**Error**: `Couldn't load XPCOM`  
**Status**: Completely broken - will not work on any user's computer  

## 🔍 What's Wrong

The Oasis app you distributed is a **development build** with these fatal problems:

1. **15 out of 16 component files are broken symlinks** pointing to `/Users/adamkershnenr/Documents/firefox-oasis/` (which doesn't exist on users' computers)

2. **Missing core XPCOM libraries** (`libxpcom.dylib`, `xpcomglue.dylib`) that the browser needs to function

3. **Incomplete application bundle** - missing essential browser components

## 🛠️ How to Fix

### Build Configuration
```bash
./mach configure \
  --enable-application=browser \
  --enable-release \
  --disable-debug
```

### Key Requirements
- ✅ Build all components into the `.app` bundle (no external symlinks)
- ✅ Include `libxpcom.dylib` and `xpcomglue.dylib`
- ✅ Package component manifests with actual content
- ✅ Test on clean macOS before distributing

## 📋 Before You Ship

- [ ] App launches without "Couldn't load XPCOM" error
- [ ] All components are self-contained (no broken symlinks)
- [ ] Tested on clean macOS installation
- [ ] No development path dependencies

**Bottom Line**: Fix the build process to create self-contained bundles, or users will never be able to use the app.
